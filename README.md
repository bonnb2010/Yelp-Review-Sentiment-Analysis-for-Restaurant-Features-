## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes Yelp restaurant reviews to uncover which features — such as **cuisine type, price level, location, and sentiment** — are most associated with **positive reviews from users with dietary needs** (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, halal).

The goal is to help:
- 🥗 **Consumers** find inclusive, well-reviewed restaurants
- 🍴 **Restaurants** improve offerings and marketing
- 📢 **Marketers** identify value signals in niche food segments
- 🔎 **Platforms** like Yelp enhance filter and recommendation systems

---

## 💡 Key Research Questions

- What business features correlate with 4–5 star reviews from users with dietary restrictions?
- How does review sentiment vary by cuisine, price level, or region?
- Can we predict high-rated reviews using structured metadata and unstructured text?

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Sourcing**: Yelp Open Dataset (Restaurants & Reviews)
2. **Filtering**: Focused on U.S.-based restaurants with >100 reviews
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Identified reviews mentioning dietary terms
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using TextBlob and VADER to score polarity
5. **Feature Engineering**: Review length, price, cuisine, location, sentiment, etc.
6. **Modeling**: Trained classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict high satisfaction
7. **Insights**: Ranked feature importance and visualized patterns
